# Pygubu Designer Menu Bar

This Visual Code Studio extension allows [Pygubu Designer](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu-designer) to be easily launched from within the Visual Studio Code interface. Two extra buttons are added to the editor menu bar:

- The open button, opens a file in Pygubu Designer. This launches `pygubu-designer` with the current file passed as an argument. This button will only appear if a `.ui` file (pygubu user interface file) is currently selected in the editor.
- The new button creates a new file in Pygubu Designer This launches `pygubu-designer` without a file argument. This button will always be visible.

## Features

Select a `.ui` pygubu-designer file in the project and use the open button in the editor menu bar to open the `.ui` file in `pygubu-designer`. Use the new button in the editor menu bar to open `pygubu-designer` to create a new `.ui` file.
