This Visual Code Studio extension allows [Pygubu Designer](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu-designer) to be easily launched from within the Visual Studio Code interface. Two extra buttons are added to the editor menu bar:

- <img src="./images/new-file-light.png" style="float:left; width:30px" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Creates a new file in Pygubu Designer This launches pygubu-designer without a file argument.

  

- <img src="./images/open-file-light.png" style="float:left; width:30px" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens a file in Pygubu Designer. This launches pygubu-designer with the current file passed as an argument. This button will only appear if a .ui file (pygubu user interface file) is currently selected in the editor.
